# Memory Game Frontend

This directory will host the Angular client for the memory game. The project is not scaffolded yet; follow the steps below once the Angular CLI is available locally.

1. Install repo-level dependencies from the project root: `npm install`
2. Generate the project using the local CLI: `npm run ng -- new memory-game --directory . --routing --style=scss`
3. Start the development server (once the Angular app defines one): `npm start`

Upcoming tasks:
- Define the card data model and board state management.
- Implement the basic matching gameplay loop.
- Integrate image datasets (local and remote).
